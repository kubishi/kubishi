                        <b>Before there was English, there was nanüümüyadohana</b>.
                        According to mythology, the Nüümü (people) originally learned the language from the animals.
                        For thousands of years, they used it to talk, sing, and tell stories.
                        They gave names to all the places in Payahuunadü and to all the plants and animals it was home to.
                        Due to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Genocide'>California Genocide</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans'>forced assimilation</a>, many of these names are no longer used.
                        Some stories are forgotten.
                        Some songs, already sung for the last time. 
                        <b> The language <a href='http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4692'>is dying</a>, but it can be healed. </b>
                        The Tribes of the Owens Valley <a href='http://www.ovcdc.com/blog/language/'>are fighting</a> to preserve the language and culture.
                        Kubishi is proud to be a part of that fight.

                        Our mission is to help preserve and protect Owens Valley Paiute history, language, and culture.
                        This website is an online dictionary and encyclopedia dedicated to Payahuunadü and its first people.

                        Kubishi was created and is maintained by <a href='https://jaredraycoleman.com'>Jared Coleman</a>, member of the <a href='http://bigpinepaiute.org'>Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owen's Valley</a>.
                        The majority of words and sentences in this dictionary are from the Owens Valley Paiute Dictionary, created by Big Pine Paiute tribal member Glenn Nelson Jr.
                        It is thanks to his work, and the native speakers and elders he worked with, that this website is possible.

                        If you don't have the means to make a financial contribution (I get it - I'm a student!) but can afford to donate a little time, then contact me.
                        Kubishi is an eternal work in progress, and we need volunteers to proof words and sentences, add articles, and help design new features.
                        With your help, we can make Kubishi a powerful weapon in the fight against the erasure of Owens Valley Paiute language and culture!
